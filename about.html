	<h3> Story Of Self </h3>
	<p> Hello. My name is Trang, and I am an upcoming senior at La Quinta High School. I grew up from a city called Sai Gon, Vietnam.  What I like to do in my spare time is listening to music, watching television, and finding new things to learn. I also enjoy getting together with my friends to hang out. Moreover, spending time with family is also one of my favorites because I can share what I am doing and any troubles I have. The school helps me to grow as an individual in many activities, meet new people, and a place for me to archive my goal.   
  <br><br>
  My dream is to make something out of my life by becoming a software engineer and volunteering at as many legal organizations as I can, so I will have the chance to gain all the necessary knowledge and experiences to push myself in the future. I want to be a software engineer who can develop a system to protect the computer and update it regularly to give the best experience for the customer. I start to be more focused and professional in one language, either Python or Java. 
  <br><br>
  During my junior year, I had an excellent opportunity to be part of an internship offered by Orange County United Way. It surprised me since I did not expect to be in the program. Unfortunately, the program canceled in-person activities and moved to virtual online due to the Covid-19 situation. But every online workshops provided me with a valuable lesson that I never experienced before. I learned lots of tips for meeting online, how to be more natural when talking with the interviewer. I also acquire knowledge of networking, how to make first impressions and management in a company. Not only that, I see the differences of transition from high school to college, and then when I get a job. It will be a whole new world open for me to try to be more familiar over time. The importance of creating a budget will help me use money in efficient way. Additionally, I have a chance to meet googlers, and it is an honor to hear stories of their life. I admire them of the way they talk, the struggles they face, and how they get into Google. It creates for me a motivation that I want to be like them when I graduate from college. This internship gives me many useful pieces of knowledge that I could apply in the future. I am thankful for the Youth Career Connection for preparing and building up this program.
