  <h3> Space Survivor </h3>
  <img src="spacesurvival.png" alt="Game" style="width:25%" align="left">
  <p> A Scratch game that make by me to turn in to College Board. The purpose of the program is to creat an enjoyable game and entertain people. The player is given three lives at the beginning. They will use arrow keys to move the astronaut around to avoid the meteorite coming at a random position. The level gets complicated when the rockets appear, and the users have to shoot at them. For each time the players shoots at the astronaut or avoids the meteorite, scores are rewarded. The player can also use the scores to exchange for extra lives by pressing the “G” button. If they lets the meteorites or rocket touch the astronaut, they will lose one life. When those lives are lost, the game ends and sends the user to a defeat screen. </p>

  <img src="2nosa.png" alt="Game" style="width:25%" align="left">
  <p> My partner and I collaborated to create the game for a project in class. This game is inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's. The game begins at midnight in the livingroom. Basically, when the game starts,in the first night, the player needs to click away the sprite that appears in font of the TV before the time reaches 0. The level gets difficult in night 2, which the player has to prevent the same sprite approaches from the TV. In addition, with a girl slides randomly around the screen with a clown in the phone on the left corner. If the time reaches 0 and the sprites still appear, they will lose the game </p>
